### Profile Inheritance

`"extends": "default"` on a profile so it only needs to override
specific actions instead of redefining everything. Reduces config
duplication when multiple profiles share most steps.

### Heartbeat for Long Tasks

With `notify run`, optionally ping every N minutes: "still running
(5m elapsed)...". Useful for 30min+ builds so you know the task
hasn't hung. E.g. `notify run --heartbeat 5m -- make build`.

### Config Bootstrapper (`notify init`)

Interactive config generator. Asks which platforms you want, generates
a starter config with credentials. Lowers the barrier for first-time
setup.

### MQTT Publish

Publish a message to an MQTT broker topic. Useful for home automation —
e.g. flash a desk light when a build finishes, or trigger any
Home Assistant automation via MQTT. Config would need broker URL, topic,
and optional auth in credentials. Payload could use template variables
like other steps.

### More Remote Notification Actions (low priority)

Additional step types beyond `discord`, `slack`, and `telegram`:

| Type       | Description                          | Platform notes |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| `email`    | Send email via SMTP                  | All (net/smtp) |
| `signal`   | Send via signal-cli                  | Needs signal-cli + Java |

Would extend `"config"` → `"credentials"` with additional webhook URLs
and API tokens. Same pattern as the existing discord/slack/telegram integration.
