### More Remote Notification Actions (low priority)

Additional step types beyond `discord`, `slack`, and `telegram`:

| Type       | Description                          | Platform notes |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| `email`    | Send email via SMTP                  | All (net/smtp) |
| `signal`   | Send via signal-cli                  | Needs signal-cli + Java |

Would extend `"config"` → `"credentials"` with additional webhook URLs
and API tokens. Same pattern as the existing discord/slack/telegram integration.
